# ludullus
A DIY python-based chess engine.

Ludullus is a diminutive form of the Latin word "ludus", which means "game". So, it's a little game. It's an original and unique chess engine.

Once the files have been checked out, it can be started with the following commands:

"python chessboard.py" - This command will start the the program without a computer player.

"python chessboard.py white" - This command will start the program with the computer playing white.

"python chessboard.py black" - This command will start the program with the computer playing black.

"python chessboard.py fen [FEN]" - This command will start the program in a position dictated by a string in Forsyth-Edwards notation. (https://www.chessclub.com/user/help/PGN-spec, section 16.1)
